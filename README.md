# EasyBlood

EasyBlood is an online portal where anybody can get blood in emergency in just one click. The person who need blood he/she has to click on
a button and fill the details of requirements like blood group and address so the message automatically conveyed to blood donors near them so they can get help as soon as possible

I used HTML, CSS and JS in frontend and PHP in backend
